The Partner Center SDK for Java provides the ability to interact with Microsoft's Partner Center service. This enables the partners to perform the Partner Center operations programmatically using Java version 8 or later. It is an open source project maintained by the partner community. Since this module is maintained by the partner community, it is not officially supported by Microsoft.
